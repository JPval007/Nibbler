This project was about making a digital 4-bit microprocessor using Atom as an IDE and compiler for the verilog language.
To achieve this, I built it based on a modular design for easy debugging and integration.
Each module performed a specialized function inside the microprocessor, as described below:
•	Program counter 
•	Program Read Only Memory 64x8
•	Random Access Memory (RAM) 4kx8
•	Arithmetic Logic Unit
•	Decoder (Control signal module)
•	Accumulator
•	Digital IO pins

The final product was intended to run on a TinyFPGA board.
